# What we actually want is to set the log level for the whole project to trace and only set it to info for the embassy_hal_internal to info.
# Unfortunotely it seems that if we set the following:
# DEFMT_LOG = "trace,embassy_hal_internal::atomic_ring_buffer=info"
# trace is also being applied to the embassy atomic ring buffer. So we have to do it the other way around, and enable
# trace for notecard crate only.
